/**
 * This class implements two interfaces and their relative methods. From BalconyInterface
 * it inherits the balcony getters. The method addCouncilor doesn't derive from the interface: this
 * because the interface is the only object exposed when communicating with the client (and
 * referring to the Fa√ßacde Pattern this implies that the client cannot access all of this
 * class methods but only the one described in the interface) and the addCouncilor method is only
 * needed on the server side, when updating the model. From the Subject interface it inherits
 * all the observer modifier methods. This interface is part of the Observer Pattern: every
 * time a subject, that is a game object or even a player, is updated, the connections of
 * each player, which are "observing" the subjects, are notified, and send the updated objects
 * to the connected clients.
